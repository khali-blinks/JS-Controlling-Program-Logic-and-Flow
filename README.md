# JS-Controlling Program Logic and Flow
This repository is dedicated to exploring and mastering decision-making in JavaScript. It contains examples and exercises demonstrating the use of various programming constructs for controlling the flow of programs.

## Topics Covered
This repository includes code and examples for the following concepts:

## Comparison Operators
* Using >, <, >=, <= for value comparisons.

## Equality Operators
* Using == (double equals) and === (triple equals) for type-safe and type-coercive equality checks.

## if Statements
* Basic conditional logic.

## else if and else Statements
* Handling multiple conditions and default cases.

## Nesting Conditionals
* Writing conditions within conditions for complex decision-making.

## Truthy and Falsy Values
* Understanding how JavaScript evaluates expressions as true or false.

## Logical Operators
* Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), and NOT (!) for combining conditions.

## Operator Precedence
* Controlling how operations are evaluated in compound expressions.

## Switch Statements
* Handling multiple conditions more efficiently with switch.

## Ternary Operators
* Writing concise conditional expressions using the condition ? trueValue : falseValue syntax.

## Purpose
The repository is a collection of my learning journey as I practice coding with decision-making constructs in JavaScript. It is aimed at reinforcing foundational concepts, building problem-solving skills, and preparing for real-world programming scenarios.

## Future Plans
I will continue to update this repository as I explore additional decision-making concepts and advanced examples in JavaScript.

## Feedback and Contributions
If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. I am eager to learn from others and collaborate.
